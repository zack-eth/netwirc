Loosely based on IRC (Internet Relay Chat), it offers a web-based medium for creating "channels" (i.e. chat rooms), controlling the way they operate, and organizing them in an intuitive hierarchy of information.  Any user can create a channel, control its user list, and dynamically find/browse existing channels hosted by other users.  Stay tuned as we add several features in the near future.</p><p>Netwirc was created by two MIT brothers, Zack and Ben Skolnik.  It's free to the public.  (View their channel at <a href='http://www.netwirc.com/benandzack'>http://www.netwirc.com/benandzack</a>)</p><p>Feel free to contact <%= mail_to("support@netwirc.com", "support@netwirc.com", :encode => "javascript") %> with any questions.
