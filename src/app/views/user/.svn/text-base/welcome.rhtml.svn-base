	<p>A personal channel has been created in your name, using default settings.  As owner, you can change these settings and administer the channel.</p>
	<p>By default, your channel is set to private mode.  This means it will not appear when users browse or search for channels.  We suggest you take a moment to invite friends.  Please enter their e-mail addresses, comma delimited, and we will send them a link to your channel (spam free)</p>
